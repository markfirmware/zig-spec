# Grammar

This folder contains the
[Parsing Expression Grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar)
for the Zig programming language.

## Build

The grammar is validated and tested using the
[`peg` parser generator](http://piumarta.com/software/peg/)
and any C compiler. Known to work C compilers include:

 * GCC >= 7.4.0

Typing `make` in this folder will create a `build` directory containing the
source files generated from `peg` and two executables, which can both parse Zig
source code.

* The `parser` executable will parse content from stdin. It exits with the
  status code `1` if the input is not valid Zig.
* `parser_debug` does the same as `parser` but also prints to stderr which
  rules are taken during parsing.

## Test

The `check_parser.sh` script can be used to check the generated parser against
the zig compiler. If no arguments are given, it checks the parser against every `.zig` file
in `grammar/tests`. Otherwise it will use the list of files given as arguments. It outputs the
filenames of the files for which success/failure for the generated parser and the compiler differ.
Note that it does *not* check whether the parse trees are isomorphic or that they fail to parse
with the same error; it only checks that either both fail to parse a zig file or both succeed.

Note: Set the ZIG environment variable to the path to your zig compiler, otherwise it will
use the `zig` in your `$PATH`.

Example usage: `./check_parser.sh`

Example usage: `./check_parser.sh myfile1.zig myfile2.zig`

Example usage: `ZIG=/path/to/zig ./check_parser.sh`
